// in middlewares, we generally can't respond with res.send(..) as the request will be fulfilled there only
// define the middleware : rateLimiter, calculateRequests -- popular middlewares. 
// Find average time that is taking our server to handle requests. -- another middleware
// app.use(express.json()) -- here inside app.use(middleware) we can write any middleware. It would be same as:
app.post("/healthy",middleware,function(req,res){

})
// indside this middleware, next() should be called so that it moves to the targeted route.


// global catches are written just before app.listen(port). They are just other middleware that modify the exception as we cant expose
everything to the end user.
