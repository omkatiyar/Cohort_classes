- **Asyc meaning** -- do tasks parallely or context switch between the tasks or delegate tasks to other threads.
Ex: 1. fs.readFile - file reading in JS, 
    2. setTimeout is a async function,
    3. Fetch - to fetch some data from an API endpoint

- **Synchronous** (Sync) meaning-- do tasks one by one, sequentially.

-- Event loop : There is call stack, web apis and callback queue (This is JS architecture)
- call stack is the stack which keeps track of the function calls or code where the main thread points. (Ex: Me)
- web apis are the APIs which are exposed by the browser to the JS code. They keep track of async functions like fs.readFile,
setTimeout etc. After this execution, the function is pushed to the callback queue. (Delegated task to Kamla Didi)
- callback queue is the queue where the functions are pushed after the execution of the web apis. 
(Now it will wait until the code is finished)(Ex: Kamla Didi will wait for me to finish my work)
After this event loop will pick the result that was pushed in callback queue.
