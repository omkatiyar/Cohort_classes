ECMAScript - It is the scripting language on which JS is based. it is just the documentation.
javascript - JS includes additional features that are not part of ECMA Script like DOM manipulation which is not defined 
by ECMAScript. More examples are: setTimeout(), fs.readFile()
NodeJS - It is not a framework or language, it is just a runtime(that can run JS or compile JS).

what can we do with NodeJS:
1. create CLIs
2. create a video player
3, create a game
4. create HTTP server (this is the main goal) (http server is most common way to communicate from frontend to backend)

IPs are used to locate the servers on internet.

How urls use to get IP? -- ***** PENDING *******

How do browser does the task whenever we type something and press enter? (i.e. fire a request)
Ans - Browser parses the url, then does the dns lookup (parses google.com to particular IP) and finally establishes a connection
with the IP (also known as handshake).
